# Forecasting Fatalities: Insights into US Armed Conflicts in 2023

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict fatalities in violent demonstrations in the United States during 2023 by analyzing historical data from 2020 to 2022. Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification, we explore geographical and temporal patterns to provide insights into conflict hotspots and inform policy-making.

## Key Questions
 - How accurately can we predict the occurrence of fatalities in violent demonstrations during 2023 based on historical data?
 - What percentage of locations in 2023 can we correctly identify as having fatalities or not?
 - Can our analysis offer meaningful insights into the outcomes of violent demonstrations in the United States?

## Findings
 - The KNN model achieved an accuracy of 83% in predicting fatalities in 2023.
 - The model correctly classified 176 out of 181 non-fatal incidents but only identified 5 out of 36 fatalities accurately.
 - Spatial analysis revealed hotspots in regions such as New York, Washington, and California, indicating significant geographical patterns in conflict occurrences.

## Conclusion
The study provides foundational insights into the spatial distribution of armed conflict fatalities in the US for 2023. Despite the limitations in predicting fatalities due to data skewness, the analysis underscores the importance of geographical and temporal trends in understanding armed conflicts. Future research should incorporate additional variables and advanced models to enhance predictive accuracy and support targeted interventions.
